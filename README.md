# D&D on YouTube: Dissecting Channel Growth and Content Strategy

**COSC 301 | Tyler Thamer | April 2026**

A full end-to-end data analytics pipeline analyzing 8 Dungeons & Dragons
YouTube channels to understand what separates large channels from small ones.

---

## Research Questions

1. Do channels grow faster from more frequent uploads?
2. Does video length affect engagement (likes, comments, views)?
3. What content patterns separate large channels from small channels?

---

## Key Findings

- **Upload frequency does not drive growth** (r=0.26, p=0.534). The most
  prolific channel (Unexpectables, 13.6 uploads/month) has only 26,500
  subscribers while less frequent channels have millions.
- **Longer videos get fewer interactions** but more total views. Engagement
  rate drops consistently from 4.8% (under 60 min) to 2.4% (180+ min),
  yet 180+ minute videos average the most views (518k).
- **Upload cadence is nearly identical** across tiers (6.44 vs 6.64
  uploads/month), meaning frequency alone does not explain channel size.
- **Small channels go even longer** than large ones (191.6 min avg vs
  155.5 min), with 63.5% of their videos exceeding 3 hours.

## How to Reproduce

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone YOUR_REPO_LINK_HERE
cd dnd-youtube-analytics
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add your API key
Create a `.env` file in the root folder: "YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyA7Qzfw4tFr8TZaDUb5ErkBSirkcP42OtA"

### 4. Run the pipeline in order
```bash
python scripts/01_collect_data.py    # collect raw data (~5 min)
python scripts/02_etl_clean.py       # clean and transform
python scripts/03_load_db.py         # load into SQLite
python scripts/04_eda.py             # EDA + figures 01-07
python scripts/05_analysis.py        # analysis + figures 08-13
python scripts/06_data_dictionary.py # generate data dictionary
```

All outputs will be saved automatically to their respective folders.

> **Note:** `data/raw/` is excluded from this repo (large JSON files).
> Re-running `01_collect_data.py` with a valid API key will regenerate it.

## Limitations

- English-language channels only; findings may not generalize beyond this sample
- VibeCheckDND only had 6 qualifying long-form videos — results for this
  channel should be interpreted with caution
- Subscriber counts are a snapshot in time, not longitudinal growth data
- Comments disabled on 0 videos in this sample, but like/comment counts
  may still be suppressed on some videos without being flagged by the API
- Sample size of 8 channels is small for channel-level correlations (Q1)

## Ethics & Disclosure

- Only public API metadata collected — no user data, no comment contents
- Fully compliant with YouTube API Terms of Service
- Large vs small comparisons reflect statistical patterns only, not quality judgments
- AI disclosure: Claude assisted with code structure and project guidance.
  All analysis, interpretation, and written findings are the student's own work.
